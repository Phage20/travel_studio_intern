Your Prisma schema is correct for your use case.
However, to ensure everything works, follow these steps:

1. Check Your .env File
Make sure you have a valid DATABASE_URL in your .env file, for example:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdbname"
Replace username, password, and yourdbname with your actual PostgreSQL credentials
2. Migrate Your Database
After editing your schema or .env, run these commands in your backend folder:
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
This will create the table in your database.

3. Generate the Prisma Client
After migration, always run:
npx prisma generate


4. Restart Your Backend
After migration and generation, restart your backend server:
npm run start

5. Test Your API
Now, POST requests to /api/requests with:
{
  "guestPhone": "555-1234",
  "requestText": "Need more pillows"
}
should work and save data to your database.

Summary:

Your schema is fine.
Make sure your DATABASE_URL is correct.
Run npx prisma migrate dev --name init and npx prisma generate.
Restart your backend.
